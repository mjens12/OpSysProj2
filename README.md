# OpSysProj2
Project 2 for Operating Systems
This program models an operating system resource manager. It takes the information it needs (the number of processes and resources, and the resource request and free steps) from a .txt file.
It uses a custom graph class as well as a custom vertex class to track the available processes and resources.
All steps in the program provide user feedback to keep the user updated as to the state of the program and the graph it uses to track the relevant details.
